## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Negative prompts are specific instructions or guidelines given to AI tools or used in the creative process to intentionally avoid certain themes, elements, or styles. They help steer your project towards more original and desired outcomes by outlining what not to include.

### How can negative prompts enhance my design projects?

By defining what to avoid, negative prompts encourage you and AI to explore creative pathways and solutions that you might not consider otherwise. This leads to more innovative, unique, and tailored design outcomes.

### Where can I learn the basics of using negative prompts?

If you're just starting out or need a refresher, our blog post "What is Negative Prompt and How to Use It" is the perfect resource. It covers the foundational knowledge required to effectively implement negative prompts in your creative work.

Consider the common errors or undesirable elements specific to your project's genre. Select negative prompts that address these issues directly, and don't be afraid to customize prompts to fit your unique creative vision.
